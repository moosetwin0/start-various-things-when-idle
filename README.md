# start various things when idle

I recommend starting once and then changing config file to match preference, I might add a 'detected config file change, restart?' message in a furture update

this requires administrator permissions for wireguard and taskkill, (see code if you are worried) 
it is recommended to run this code whenever your computer starts, I use Task Scheduler for this
